ISSUES  
  
- certain options consume too much memory and traversal is aborted  
- using current directory displays the path twice: as absolute and relative path  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

HOW TO RUN  

1. Type 'make' in the terminal  
2. Run as './bt' followed by options then directory, or './bt' followed by directory then options  
	a. ex: ./bt -l proj   OR ./bt proj -l  
3. Type 'make clean' to remove executables and object files
