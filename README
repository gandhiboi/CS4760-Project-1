[x] -h Print a help message and exit
[x] -L Follow symbolic links, if any. Default will be to not follow symbolic links

[x] -p Print permission bits asrwxrwxrwx
[x] -i Print the number of links to file in inode table
[x] -u Print the UID associated with the file
[x] -g Print the GID associated with the file
[x] -s Print the size of file in bytes.  If the size is larger than 1K, indicate the size in KB with a suffix K; if the size is larger than 1M, indicate the size in MB with a suffix M; if the size is larger than 1G, indicate the size in GB with a suffix G

ISSUES  
  
- certain options consume too much memory and traversal is aborted  
- using current directory displays the path twice: as absolute and relative path  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

HOW TO RUN  

1. Type 'make' in the terminal  
2. Run as './bt' followed by options then directory, or './bt' followed by directory then options  
	a. ex: ./bt -l proj   OR ./bt proj -l  
3. Type 'make clean' to remove executables and object files
